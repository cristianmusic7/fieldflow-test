# FieldFlow Test Project

## Setup

This is a [Convex](https://convex.dev/) project created with [`npm create convex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-convex).

After the initial setup (<2 minutes) you'll have a working full-stack app using:

- Convex as your backend (database, server logic)
- [React](https://react.dev/) as your frontend (web page interactivity)
- [Vite](https://vitest.dev/) for optimized web hosting
- [HeroUI](https://www.heroui.com/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for building great looking UI
- [Convex Auth](https://labs.convex.dev/auth) for authentication
- [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) for routing

## Get started

Create a free [Convex](https://convex.dev) account.

After cloning this repo, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The CLI will ask you to login to your Convex account and create a new project. Choose cloud deployment.
